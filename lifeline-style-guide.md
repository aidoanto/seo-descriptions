# Writing for Lifeline

Writing for Lifeline, obey these guidelines in this order:
1. SDE style guide (below)
2. General mental health nonprofit best practices for strengths-based and trauma informed content.
3. Australian Government spelling & grammar guidelines.

## SDE Style Sheet

Note that the style manual advocates minimal capitalisation and minimal punctuation, to foster clarity and a ‘respect for the reader’ approach to writing. 

However, the following list of words and terms are commonly used at Lifeline Australia and shows agreed usage that will ideally be followed to maintain consistency across all of our written materials.

#### **Words/terms to avoid:**

-   **crisis support worker** - no longer used - use _crisis supporter_ instead
-   **committed suicide** - see [Mindframe](https://mindframe.org.au/suicide/communicating-about-suicide/language) for options
-   **head office** - never use this term when referring to Lifeline Sydney office; acceptable terms include _Lifeline Australia, LLA, Lifeline Australia office, Phillip St office, national office._
-   **Hot Spot** - avoid using this term - use _high-risk public location_ ; Hot Spot capitalised, has a very specific Lifeline context - see Crisis Support Operations Manual for details
-   **mental ill-health** - this is an umbrella term often used in policy documents and prevention work to describe both mental health concerns and mental illness. While it is currently used by governments and organisations, it is not a preferred term to be used in community or with people who have personal or lived experience. ([Reference](https://everymind.org.au/understanding-mental-health/mental-health/what-is-mental-illness)) Also, see mental illness below.
