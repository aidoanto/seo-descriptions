## Collecting media

* I work for Lifeline Australia as a digital producer. We're currently in the midst of a content migration from Umbraco to Drupal.
* The current lifeline.org.au (umbraco) hosts hundreds of pdfs. We don't have time to migrate all, only the most important ones.
* Currently, if a PDF is linked from a webpage on lifeline.org.au, we have migrated it to Drupal. That should cover most of the PDFs that are currently used.
* However, we are worried about other PDFs that are not included in this, such as PDFs that are not linked to on our site but are used on other sites, such as old documents or contracts.
* These pdfs can be found at URLs starting with https://www.lifeline.org.au/media/, for example https://www.lifeline.org.au/media/usdp3jhq/understanding-lgbti-lives-in-crisis-2019.pdf
* So need to somehow search the web for these links, but not ones that are linked to on lifeline.org.au (becuase those have been done already) and then scrape the ones that are out there to /pdfs
